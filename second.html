       Mahendra Singh Dhoni is one of the most popular cricketers of India who captained the team from 2007 to 2016. Dhoni is considered as one the best wicket-keepers in world cricket and is also one of the finest captains India has ever had. He made his debut in the One Day International (ODI) in December 2004 and played his first Test a year later.
       During Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian cricket team won the highest rank in all formats, including the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, 50-over World Cup (2011) and World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007.
       Throughout his career, Dhoni has showed excellent leadership skills, which was recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007. He also actively played in the IPL by being the face of Chennai Super Kings franchise.</p>

    <h2>Virat Kohli</h2>
    <p>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. Kohli is known as a skilled batsman who plays with determination and energy. In one-day cricket, he usually bats at number three and stands with his chest slightly open and holds the bottom of his bat firmly. He's praised for his quick footwork, wide range of shots, and his talent for leading innings, especially in high-pressure situations.
       Instead of trying to hit big shots, Kohli prefers to play safe shots close to the ground.
       People admire his ability to make wrist shots and consistently perform well in the mid-wicket and cover areas. Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.</p>

    <h4>Yuvraj Singh</h4>
    <p>Yuvraj Singh (born 12 December 1981) is a former Indian international cricketer who played in all formats of the game. He was an all-rounder who batted left-handed in the middle order and bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He has won 7 Player of the Series awards in One Day International (ODI) cricket, which is a joint 3rd highest by an Indian cricketer, shared with former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. He is the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor Yograj Singh.[3]
       Yuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in ODIs from 2000 to 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. In a match against England at the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart Broad[4]â€”a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with Test match status. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls, which was a record for fastest half century in International cricket, until it was broken by Dipendra Airee during 2023 Asian Games but Singh still holds the record in the ICC Cricket World Cup and among ICC full member nations. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World Cup match. During the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh played eight innings in nine matches and scored 362 runs at a remarkable average of 90.50.[5] He also took 15 wickets in the tournament, maintaining an economy rate of 5.02.[6]
       In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.[7] In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20.</p>
